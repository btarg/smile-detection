This program will track faces in its vision, and detect any smiles. It will then add "True" to the list if it detected a smile, or "False" if it did not.
If "True" is the most common value in the list, then the program detects that the person in the image is happy, and will try to make them sad by insulting them.

## Installing dependencies
To install the requirements, run the following command in the code's directory:

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can replace `py` with `python`, `python3` or a specific version such as `python3.6` if the above command doesn't work.
On **Linux**, you can also use `pip3` or `pip` without the python command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the program
You can run the program through the Python command within the command line. You can also use the provided Shell Script or Batch File, or use an IDE such as **[Thonny.](https://thonny.org/)**

## Running under Python 2.x
Currently, this version of the program only works with Python 3, however, it would be very easy to port it to Python 2, by replacing `print(stuff)` with `print stuff` etc.

Feel free to Fork the repo and create your own version!
